           ,'2023-05-04'
           ,'Having two drugs slow the disease by targeting amyloid in the brain has also convinced scientists they are on the right track after decades of misery and failure.

"This should dispel any lingering doubts about this approach," Prof John Hardy, from the UK Dementia Research Institute, whose work led to the idea of targeting amyloid, 30 years ago, said. "Having two drugs is great for competition."

Dr Susan Kolhaas, from Alzheimer`s Research UK, said: "We are now on the cusp of a first generation of treatments for Alzheimers disease, something that many thought impossible only a decade ago."

However, these drugs appear to work in only the earliest stages of the disease - before the brain is too damaged.

And if they are approved in the UK, it would still take a revolution in how the disease is diagnosed to make a difference.

Only 1-2% of people have either brain scans or a spinal-fluid analysis to determine whether they actually have Alzheimers or another form of dementia against which the drugs would be useless.

And the NHS would have to decide whether it could afford them. Lecanemab costs more than £21,000 per person per year.'

           ,'2023-05-04'
           ,'The top US data privacy regulator has accused Meta, the firm that owns Facebook and Instagram, of not putting proper parental controls in place.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) also said Meta should be banned from making money from childrens data.

"The companys recklessness has put young users at risk, and Facebook needs to answer for its failures," it said.

Meta hit back, calling the regulators move a "political stunt" and accusing it of overstepping its authority.

The FTC said an independent investigation had found "several gaps and weaknesses in Facebooks privacy program" that posed "substantial risks to the public".

Users aged under 13 were found to be still allowed to engage in chats with contacts not vetted by parents.

The regulator also said Meta continued to give third-party apps access to private information after promising to cut off access if users failed to use the apps in the previous 90 days.'

           ,'2023-04-27'
           ,'Spain recorded its hottest ever temperature for April on Thursday, hitting 38.8C according to the countrys meteorological service.

The record figure was reached in Cordoba airport in southern Spain just after 15:00 local time (14:00 BST).

For days a blistering heatwave has hit the country with temperatures 10-15C warmer than expected for April.

It is been driven by a mass of very hot air from Africa, coupled with a slow moving weather system.

"This is not normal. Temperatures are completely out of control this year," Cayetano Torres, a spokesman for Spains meteorological office, told BBC News.

Experts were surprised by the scale of the heat experienced across southern Spain in recent days.

"This heat event in Spain is absolutely extreme, unprecedented with temperatures never seen before in April. In some locations records are being beaten by a 5C margin, which is something that has happened only a handful of times at weather stations around the world," said Maximiliano Herrera, a climatologist who runs an Extreme Temperatures twitter account.'
